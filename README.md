seismic-data-processing
=======================

This project consists of developing a software tool (graphical user interface) for processing and visualization of 2-D seismic data.
The application is completely developed in python, hence multiplatform, and such that it will be easy to for other students/professionals to use and build on top of it.
The goal of this project is to implement the following processing stages :
1- de-noising
2- normal move out correction
3- stacking
4- time migration
Furthermore, the user will be able to display his/her data using different views.
